FOr this project to run, we first need to create a schema named "employeedb2023" and a table named "employee_table". The "employee_table" should have following columns:
email, password, fullName, gender and age. All of these have type varchar(45).
I have my email and password hardcoded as admin email and password in this project so we also need to add email and password in the database. email has to be babitagurung03101998@gmail.com and password has to be test@123.
